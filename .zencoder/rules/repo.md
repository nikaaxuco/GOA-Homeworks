# Repository Overview

## Project Structure
- **Level 00 â€“ Level 99**: Each level contains `Classwork` and `Homework` subdirectories. Code exercises, HTML/CSS/JS snippets, and practice problems live here.
- **vite-project**: Standalone Vite application with its own `src`, `public`, `index.html`, and package files.
- **.vscode**: Workspace-specific settings for Visual Studio Code.

## Recommended Conventions
1. **Classwork vs Homework**
   - **Classwork** holds in-lesson examples and demos.
   - **Homework** contains assignments to complete. Files are typically named `cw.*` or `hw.*`.
2. **JavaScript Files**
   - Use descriptive variable names and keep console output or DOM manipulation near the bottom of the file.
3. **HTML/CSS Files**
   - Keep styles in the associated CSS file when possible and ensure links to CSS/JS are correct.
4. **Vite Project**
   - Run with `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` from the `vite-project` directory.

## Getting Started
1. Open the repository root: `c:\Users\PC\OneDrive\Desktop\goa-homework`.
2. Navigate to the level and task you are working on.
3. Follow assignment instructions or request help specifying the exact level/file.

## Tips for Assistance
- Provide the level, task (Classwork/Homework), and file name when asking for help.
- Mention the desired outcome (e.g., DOM update, array manipulation, styling change).
- Share any error messages or unexpected behavior you encounter.

This guide can be extended as new projects or conventions are added.
